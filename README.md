This is a high-performance Twitter clone built with the Phoenix Framework, Elixir, and Tailwind CSS. The application uses the BEAM virtual machine to handle real-time functionality such as personalized user timelines, tweet sharing, and follower systems with very high concurrency.

The application has an industry-standard authentication process, which is secure for account activation and password reset. To make it production-ready, it uses PostgreSQL for relational database management, Mailjet for transactional email services, and AWS S3 for cloud media storage.

The project is hosted here: [https://live-vacant-ringworm.gigalixirapp.com/](url)
However, the link may not work as I am using a free plan on Gigalixir which only allows me to host one project at a time. So, if it doesn't work that means I am hosting another project. Broke uni student moment.
